## Data Engineering Capstone Project

This is the capstone project from the 
data engineer nanodegree of udacity. 

## Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data

First of all, the goal of this project is to prepare data for 
a predictive model that attemps to predict case count of COVID-19
in New York city using yellow and  green taxi records in new york city 
from february to july.

The data were obtained from the following web sites:

[TLC Trip Record Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)

[NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data)
 
In order to download the data we used the following bash script 
in a m5.xlarge AWS EC2 instance with Ubuntu Server 16.04 installed.
